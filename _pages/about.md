Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the **Department of Geography and Environment** at the **LSE**. \
I am also a CEP associate and a fellow of the Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti.

I received my PhD from CEMFI in 2024. You can find my CV <a href="https://giorgiopietrabissa.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am an economist with research interests in urban, international and public economics, with a specific focus on issues related to inequality. In my research, I use quantitative empirical tools from IO and trade, to understand how public policies affect the functioning of markets across space and shape spatial inequalities.
