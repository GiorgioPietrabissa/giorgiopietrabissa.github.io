Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in economics at <a href="https://www.cemfi.es/" target="_blank">CEMFI</a>. You can find my CV <a href="https://giorgiopietrabissa.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I will join the **Department of Geography and Environment** at the **LSE** starting September 2024.

I am an economist with research interests in urban, international, and labor economics and a specific focus on inequality. I use quantitative tools from trade and empirical IO.

In my research, I study how public policies and their interplay with multiple markets determine spatial inequalities and the distribution of economic activity.
