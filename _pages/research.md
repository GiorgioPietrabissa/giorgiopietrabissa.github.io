## School Access and City Structure
This paper investigates how school, labor and housing markets interact determining life-cycle mobility and location choices of heterogeneous households within a city. I develop a quantitative spatial model that nests parental school choice, as well as an endogenous labor market populated also by child-less households. Both types of agents vary in terms of skills, which matter for preferences, wages and incomes, as well as for the endogeneity of amenities, including school quality. In equilibrium, competition in the housing market, along with the interactions between the labor and school markets, determines the residential structure across neighborhoods. I estimate the model with data from the city of Madrid, exploiting an exogenous change in the allocation system of students to schools for the identification of preferences and to resolve endogeneity concerns. Counterfactual exercises reveal the extent to which the multi-market nature of the city matters for welfare inequality and sorting across skills, and the effects of educational policies in equilibrium.
