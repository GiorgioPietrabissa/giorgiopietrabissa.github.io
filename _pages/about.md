I’m an Assistant Professor at the **Department of Geography and Environment** at the **LSE**. \
I am also an associate at the Center for Economic Performance (CEP) and a fellow of the Fondazione Rodolfo Debenedetti.\
I received my PhD from CEMFI in 2024. You can find my CV <a href="https://giorgiopietrabissa.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

My research interests lie in urban, international and public economics, with a specific focus on inequality. I use quantitative empirical methods to understand how public policies affect economic outcomes across space and shape spatial inequalities.

This year, I co-organize the Online Spatial and Urban Seminar! Click <a href="https://osus.info/">here</a> for more info and to join.\
I'm looking to hire a full-time RA at the CEP for the next academic year, alongside <a href="https://personal.lse.ac.uk/sturmd/">Daniel Sturm</a> and <a href="https://sarabagagli.github.io/">Sara Bagagli</a>. Find more info on the call <a href="https://jobs.lse.ac.uk/Vacancies/I/6762/0/461348/15539/research-assistant-cep-urban">here</a>.
