Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in economics from [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es/). You can find my CV [here](https://giorgiopietrabissa.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

I will be available for interviews on the **2023-2024 Academic Job Market**.

I am an economist with research interests in urban, international and labor economics, and a specific focus on inequality. I use quantitative tools from trade and IO.

In my research I study how the interplay of multiple markets within cities determines spatial inequalities and the distribution of economic activity.
