Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the **Department of Geography and Environment** at the **LSE**. I received my PhD from CEMFI in 2024. You can find my CV <a href="https://giorgiopietrabissa.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am an economist with research interests in urban, international, and labor economics and a specific focus on inequality. I use quantitative tools from trade and empirical IO.

In my research, I study how public policies impact multiple markets and determine spatial inequalities and the distribution of economic activity.
