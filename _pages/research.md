*Job Market Paper* - Draft Coming soon!

<span style="font-size:15px">
    This paper quantifies the effects of schools on the economic structure of cities. While their effect on residential choices of households with kids is well-known, I explore two new channels: the indirect consequences they have on childless households and the interactions they establish with the labor market. Using data from Madrid, I first unveil extensive spatial sorting based on whether a household has children and link it to the need of parents to access both schools and workplaces. Then, I develop a general equilibrium quantitative urban model with households differentiated by parenthood and skills. The framework incorporates the school choice problem faced by parents, and allows for schools to affect both housing and labor markets in equilibrium. The empirical estimation relies on a unique dataset covering the universe of applications to publicly funded schools, with which I estimate parentsâ€™ preferences and quantify school access. To address the endogeneity between neighborhood composition and school quality I exploit exogenous variation based on the historical expansion of the city. Counterfactual simulations reveal how the labor market exerts stronger consequences for schools than vice versa. This is because peer-effects in school quality propel the effects of the labor market, while childless households offset the impacts of schools. These mechanisms bear significant implications for policies increasing school choice and for the city-wide consequences of teleworking.

## The Welfare Effects of Public Housing: Evidence from the Netherlands
*Joint with <a href="https://www.milena-almagro.com/" target="_blank">Milena Almagro</a> & <a href="https://www.urbaneconomics.nl/" target="_blank">Hans Koster</a>*

Governments worldwide invest significant amounts of money to provide affordable housing, yet little is known about the value that this provides to eligible individuals or society at large. In this project, we assess the welfare and distributional effects of subsidized rent-controlled public housing specifically targeting low-income households. To do so, we set up a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework accounting for factors such as tenure choice, wait times, housing prices and characteristics, as well as local externalities of public housing on privately-owned housing. For estimation, we first georeference electoral results from the early 20th century to isolate the supply channel of local public housing through the support for early construction programs. Then, using microdata from the Netherlands, we estimate how eligible low-income households trade-off the option of living in public housing against market-rate units. Preliminary evidence suggests that affordable housing can induce substantial externalities on the private market, beyond direct local externalities, as demand connects the two segments of the market. This relation implies unexplored distributional consequences of the provision of public housing.
