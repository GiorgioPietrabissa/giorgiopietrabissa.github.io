Hi, welcome to my website.

I'm a 5th year PhD student at [**Cemfi**](https://www.cemfi.es/), and my research focuses on urban and spatial economics.

My research explores the factors influencing residential choices, spatial inequalities and the impact of our interactions on economic activity, utilizing quantitative tools from trade and IO.

I have a passion for maps - they allow us to bring complex data to life in a beautiful way.
