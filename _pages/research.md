*Job Market Paper* - Draft Coming soon!

This paper quantifies the effects of schools on the economic structure of cities. While their direct effect on the residential choices of households with kids is well-established, I explore the indirect consequences they bear for childless households and the geography of labor supply. Using data from Madrid, I first unveil extensive spatial sorting based on whether a household has children and link it to the need of parents to access both schools and workplaces. Then, I develop a general equilibrium quantitative urban model with households differentiated by parenthood and skills. This incorporates the school choice problem faced by parents, and allows for schools to affect both housing and labor markets in equilibrium. The empirical estimation relies on a unique dataset covering the universe of applications to publicly funded schools, with which I estimate parentsâ€™ preferences and quantify school access. To address the endogeneity between neighborhood composition and school quality I exploit exogenous variation based on the historical expansion of the city. Counterfactual simulations reveal that, by constraining the residential choices of parents, schools induce an opposite reallocation by childless households, which halves the effects on the housing and labor market. The model further unveils substantial cross-market effects between the school and labor markets, which have significant implications for policies increasing school choice and to understand the consequences of teleworking.

## The Welfare Effects of Public Housing: Evidence from the Netherlands

Governments worldwide invest significant amounts of money to provide affordable housing, yet little is known about the value that this provides to eligible individuals or society at large. In this project, we assess the welfare and distributional effects of subsidized rent-controlled public housing specifically targeting low-income households. To do so, we set up a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework accounting for factors such as tenure choice, wait times, housing prices and characteristics, as well as local externalities of public housing on privately-owned housing. For estimation, we first georeference electoral results from the early 20th century to isolate the supply channel of local public housing through the support for early construction programs. Then, using microdata from the Netherlands, we estimate how eligible low-income households trade-off the option of living in public housing against market-rate units. Preliminary evidence suggests that affordable housing can induce substantial externalities on the private market, beyond direct local externalities, as demand connects the two segments of the market. This relation implies unexplored distributional consequences of the provision of public housing.
