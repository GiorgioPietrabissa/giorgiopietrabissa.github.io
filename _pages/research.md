  This paper quantifies the effect of schools on the internal structure of cities by developing a quantitative spatial model that incorporates school choice. Parents select their residence by balancing access to schools and jobs, choose a school considering its endogenous peer composition, and compete with childless households for houses and jobs. For estimation, I leverage data from Madrid on school admissions, workers' commuting trips by skill, and the location, composition, and education of every household in the city. Schools influence parental residential and job choices, but non-parents reduce by 40% the impact of schools on house prices and the distribution of workers by moving to locations less favored by parents. Commuting costs concentrate skilled households in productive areas, and as parents tend to enroll children in schools close to their homes, peer effects in school quality triple the impact of jobs on the distribution of students. The equilibrium interactions between schools and the labor market significantly affect the outcome of policies increasing school choice and the city-wide consequences of work-from-home.

Governments worldwide invest significant amounts of money to provide affordable housing, yet little is known about the value that this provides to eligible individuals or society at large. In this project, we assess the welfare and distributional effects of subsidized rent-controlled public housing specifically targeting low-income households. To do so, we set up a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework accounting for factors such as tenure choice, wait times, housing prices and characteristics, as well as local externalities of public housing on privately-owned housing. For estimation, we first georeference electoral results from the early 20th century to isolate the supply channel of local public housing through the support for early construction programs. Then, using microdata from the Netherlands, we estimate how eligible low-income households trade-off the option of living in public housing against market-rate units. Preliminary evidence suggests that affordable housing can induce substantial spillovers on the private market, beyond direct local externalities, as demand connects the two segments of the market. This relation implies unexplored distributional consequences of the provision of public housing.
