Giorgio Pietrabissa
======
5th year PhD student at Cemfi.

My research focuses on urban economics. I'm interested in understanding what drives _where_ people live and the spatial distribution of economic activity, as location matters for every aspect of our lives. I use a combination of trade and IO tools to answer deep questions about the spatial and economic structure of where we live.
