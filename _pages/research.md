  This paper quantifies the effects of schools on the structure of cities by developing a quantitative spatial model that incorporates school choice. Parents select their residence by balancing access to schools and employment, choose a school considering its endogenous peer composition, and compete with childless households for houses and jobs. I leverage data on school admissions and workers' commuting trips by skill in Madrid to estimate preferences for schools and workplaces. I combine data on the universe of households with exogenous variation from the city's historical expansion to estimate neighborhood preferences separately from the endogeneity of school quality. I find that frictions to school access influences parental residential and job choices, reducing segregation across parents by 15\% and shifting workers towards highly productive areas. The endogenous response of non-parents almost halves the city-wide effects of schools. Work commuting costs concentrate skilled households in central locations, increasing school quality differences for students from high and low-skill families by 2.6\%. Peer effects in school quality amplify the spatial impact of jobs on the distribution of students. Finally, I show that the equilibrium interactions between schools and the labor market matter for the outcome of policies increasing school choice and the consequences of work-from-home.

Governments worldwide invest significant amounts of money to provide affordable housing, yet little is known about the value that this provides to eligible individuals or society at large. In this project, we assess the welfare and distributional effects of subsidized rent-controlled public housing specifically targeting low-income households. To do so, we set up a dynamic spatial equilibrium framework accounting for factors such as tenure choice, wait times, housing prices and characteristics, as well as local externalities of public housing on privately-owned housing. For estimation, we first georeference electoral results from the early 20th century to isolate the supply channel of local public housing through the support for early construction programs. Then, using microdata from the Netherlands, we estimate how eligible low-income households trade-off the option of living in public housing against market-rate units. Preliminary evidence suggests that affordable housing can induce substantial spillovers on the private market, beyond direct local externalities, as demand connects the two segments of the market. This relation implies unexplored distributional consequences of the provision of public housing.
