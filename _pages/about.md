Hi, welcome to my website.
======
I'm a 5th year PhD student at **Cemfi**, and my research focuses on urban economics.

I'm interested in understanding the drivers of _where_ people choose to live, and _how_ our interactions shape the spatial distribution of economic activity, using quantitative tools from IO and trade. In short, I like maps.
